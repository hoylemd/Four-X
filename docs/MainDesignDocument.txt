Four-X Design Document

Four-X, as it's name suggests, will be a 4X game, modelled after Master of Orion 2, with some influences from Tropico 2: pirates Cove and Sid Mier's Civilization.

Point-form design specifications:
	General game:
		- Turn-based
	Construction
		- Things are build from Industry points
		- 2 types: Base construction, and Planetary Construction
		- base construction is mostly buildings
		- planetary construction is things that affect the whole planet (ships, stations, etc)
		- Only Bases generate Industry (at first)
		- Planetary Construction is done with excess base Industry
		- Bases may be set to contribute a % or value of their Industry to Planetary Construction\
	Population
		- Population units are used to generate funds, Industry, Food, Research, and to staff Military assets.
		- very large ships may require population
		- population growth is done on a per-base basis
		- each pop unit generates pop growth based on it's morale
		- when a base accumulates 100 pop growth, it will spawn a new pop unit.
		- Pop units may be assigned to one of 4 jobs, Industry, Agriculture, Research, or Military
		- The vast majority of a bases pop should be in non-military things.
		- a population unit does not represent a set number of people, but a functional unit that may represent more or less people as an empire's situation changes.
		- A population unit generates 1 Wealth/turn base. This can be modified by morale, technology, and Laws
		- Population represents not just the people, but corporations and firms as well
		- IF morale is low enough, Population units may rebel, and produce nothing, but still consume resources
		- rebels may be rounded up, executed, exiled, or morale may be improved and they will return to work.
		- A job with no population assigned to it generates resources as if it had half a unit assigned to it, representing the logical assumption that basic critical jobs would be filled as needed. Research is exempt from this, as it is in no way critical.
		- Population can be moved from base to base
		- it takes no time to move them within the same system, but move at maximum warp speed between systems. Each population unit takes up 4 cargo space, and needs free freighter space in the source system to make the voyage
		- Each planet/moon/asteroid/barge has a set maximum population it can support.
		- Population stops generating growth if it's planet/moon/Asteroid/Barge is at it's capacity.
		- if for some reason a world has more population than it can support, those extra populations function as if they have no food.
	Agriculture
		- each unit of population consumes 1 unit of food per turn
		- food is dealt with on a planetary scale, but it is generated by bases.
		- food represents everything for people to live comfortably.
		- extra food increases morale, and provides a bonus to population growth
		- A population unit that goes unfed generates negative pop growth, based on an inverse of it's morale
	Research
		- Each population unit assigned to Research generates 1 Research per turn, modified by morale, and technologies
		- Research is handled on a per-empire level
		- all technology is part of a tech web
		- Each technology has a research cost, which must be paid into that technology's "account".
		- Each tech also has a number of "levels", which may be researched to improve that technology.
		- Researching a technology will unlock adjacent technologies
		- Some technologies will also require some resources (?)
		- Some technologies will be hidden from an empire at random from the start of a game, and unless this technology is encountered, it cannot be unlocked or researched.  These are called "hidden" techs.
		- hidden techs cost substantially more research to discover than regular ones unless a n example of the technology is available to the empire
		- Technology can be traded
		- if a technology is given to an epire, it needs 5% of it's total research cost to be integrated into the mpire's knowledge base.
		- Technology can be traded
	Economy
		- An empire's economic reserves are measured in Wealth units.
		- an empire may have a surplus or a deficit (per-turn change in reserves).
		- Deficits affect morale, and increase the cost of all wealth expenditures.
		- Each turn, and empire's GDP is calculated based on it's total industry and agriculture produced that turn, and is used to describe the general state of an empire's economy.
		- if an empire's deficit exceeds it's GDP, morale will be -100%, and rebellions become very likely
		- trade treaties and taxes may be set for other empires, and trade is calculated based on the GDPs of both empires. It is assumed trade is carried out by corporations. If is possible for an empire to lose wealth from trading if their partner's economy is weak enough.
	Planets
		- a lot of planets can support life, but very few are useful without some terraforming.
		- it should be reasonable cost-wise to build space barges as opposed to colonize planets
	Military
		- Military is dealt with on a planetary scale
		- Population units allocated to the Military job each have a "force capacity", a total "value" of military forces they may support. This includes ship crews, ground forces, and spies.
		- Unimproved forces are assumed to be reserves, equipped with only basic equipment.
		- when a military asset is produced, it subtracts its force capacity from it's home world's force capacity.
		- when a military asset is destroyed, it's force capacity is "tapped." Military population units contribute their population growth to freeing tapped force capacity before population growth
	Ships
		- ships may be assigned to a system
		- Ships may be designed by the player
		- They may be assigned a "Role" by design, but this may be changed at any time.
		- Roles: Freighter, Combat, Colonization, Exploration
			- Freighter:
				Usually assigned to a system, they ferry goods around the system, and export them to other systems if neccesary
			- Combat:
				Patrol the system they are in,and will automatically request to enguage enemies that enter their system. May be set to "hunting", where they will actively seek out enemies
			- Colonization:
				If any worlds have been flagged for colonization, these ships will automatically move to colonize them.
			- Exploration:
				Will move to any unexplored systems in range, and avoid combat
		- Roles affect the ship's AI, but any ship may be directly ordered to any task it's capeable of.
		- Ships may be grouped into fleets. A fleet behaves as a single ship with resources pooled
		- in combat, fleets temporarily break up so they may be given orders individually.
		- characteristics:
			- Crew Level
			- initiative
			- Attack
			- Defense
			- Structure
			- Armour
			- Shield
			- Weapons
			- Systems
			- Engines
	Ship combat
		- If a fleet moves to enguage another, the defending fleet may allocate ships from the fleet to either fight or retreat. a retreat roll is made before combat begins, which is an opposed initiative roll using the worst initiative from the retreating ships. At the end of the first turn, any remaining retreating ships automatically escape.
		- Ships may choose to retreat from combat at the beginning of any turn. They get no actions for the turn, and at the end of the turn they will escape.
		- A ships crew generates Action points based on the ship's size, crew level, and any command systems
		- Actions:
			- Recharge Shields: charges a fraction of the ship's shields based on the crew level of the ship
			- Repair System: restore a damaged system to full working order
			- Reload projectiles
			- move
			- Fire weapon
			- use System
		- A ship may conduct a boarding action on an immobile ship
			- The ship must move adjecent to the target ship
			- the ship counts as immobile for a turn
			- Boarding actions resolve automatically. If some boarders survive the action, they may retreat or stay.
	Heroes
		- A unit uses it's heros stats when they are better that the unit.
		- For retreat actions, a heros initiative may be used instead of the worst.
		- may add Action points to their ship/unit

Cool Ideas:
	- Build bases on planets, asteroids, or potentially mobile space barges/stations.
	- Multiple start conditions (Pirate Lord, Planetary Magistrate, Colonist Commander)
	- Multiple Victory Conditions
	- Optional tactical ship combat
	- Extensive tech tree 
	- Manually or automatically design ships
	- Real-time or turn-based ship combat
	- Tactical planetary combat;
	- Tactical Boarding Actions
	- unused land in bases is automatically used by civilians
	- morale represents a function of health, happiness, and access to services
	- Scripted scenarios
